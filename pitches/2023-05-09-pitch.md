Our project draws inspiration from ancient legends, such as the Chinese dragon that guards the mountains in Chinese mythology. We seek to modernize this legend by creating a new Swiss creature inspired by the Tschaggatta, which will take care of old cable cars and preserve them for future generations. By offering protection, this creature will help keep the cable car in good condition. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the past and present by using fascinating cultural elements to inspire future generations to explore and appreciate history in new ways.

The Swiss landscape we create will be inspired by the Poyas technique, a traditional Swiss method of depicting rural life and nature through intricate woodcarvings. By incorporating these elements, we hope to create a unique and memorable experience that connects the past and present in a meaningful way.
