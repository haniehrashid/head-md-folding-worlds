## Pitch

You find yourself in a winter landscape, and suddenly, a mysterious creature appears. In order to reach the center of the world, you have the power to move the mountain and uncover the path. Once you find the center, you can ride the creature across the mountain, transforming winter into spring.

## Synopsis
The goal is to move the mountains and the creature. Your objective is to guide the creature towards the center of the world. Upon reaching the center, a remarkable revelation awaits you: the power to soar over the mountains and bring the essence of spring to the entire world. Uniquely, as the creature moves, part of its body gracefully descends, releasing a cascade of vibrant flowers that symbolize the arrival of the spring season, rejuvenating the world around you.

## Visual Interaction Loop
 - When you stand and look around, nothing special will happen, but you can discover the world. 
 - WWhen you raise your open hand and move it from left to right (for the right hand) or right to left (for the left hand), you can move the mountain and clear a path for creatures to move through and find the center of the world.
 - when you shake your fist up and down you can guide creature to move
